## Visualize how everything can be different.

First, try a cup of my lentil soup.  Relax.  Then, we will discuss your particular need and my prescription for a most compelling intervention.  

As you enjoy, consider.  What would you do to help make purchases more affordable for buyers, yet defend the most basic expectation, that buyers would respectfully reciprocate?  Let's suppose I asked you to pay me for that wonderous soup with fractions of your services in the form of contracts instead of money.  

## OK. Let's get to know each other, so others can.   

Exactly, what would you offer me, in exchange?  And how much?  How would we define a "denomination" or a fraction of a service?  Moreover, as a service, can the identity of the service recipient role be made "reassignable" beyond me, the person such service was directly offered to?  In other words, would you be capable of honoring someone else's request for contract performance?  If so, that would mean, we could engineer an actual contract for that service and it can become a commodity.  
 
And for every contract that you supply and I accept as payment, the market can, with each ensuing exchange, promote you as a legitimate service provider.  Let everyone who can work, work.  There can be a ledger.  Every time a seller accepts your contract, he or she can bear it as a buyer to another seller to propagate your existence and the availability of your services across an economy, so everyone can be incentivized to know of you.  Where are we going with this?

## We can architect a national currency that employs all.

We are actually "ad hoc engineering" salient features of a hypothetical just-in-time national currency, whereby supply to the economy, of any buyer promise to perform services, takes place precisely upon any seller's acceptance of the promise as payment.  Eventually, some buyer will present the contract as payment to a seller who is actually looking for the literal service that it guarantees. Now at this point, whereby the seller, who is the new negotiable contract bearer, deliberately fails to perpetuate "surrogate value utility" of the instrument--at precisely this point, the maker of the contract has finally achieved his or her principal purpose, to discover employment.  Service contracts are ultimately transmuted from "advertisements of service" to actual directives; the contract maker, the buyer, goes to work.   
   
Meaningfully here, I have actually articulated a process for how any country may achieve "full employment".   

## So, accept buyer promises. Make needs affordable.   

Considering a judicious buyer restraint, hallmark of a responsible negotiable fiat contract maker, I posit, everything that is needed by a Citizen, anywhere, can ultimately become affordable.  Let's engineer "frictionless transactions" to address buyer objections based upon price to start off our hypothetical economic boom.  With readily accessible supply that any freelancer can engineer, everyone can execute more transactions.  More transactions means, even more people with means can discover us, if only to subsidize those without means we have exchanged with.  Just exchange.  Exchange to measure.  Exchange to promote.  There can be no truly bad transaction in pursuit of understanding how our inhomogeneous values relate.  "Frictionless" is, to the seller, only overtly a sacrifice of the liquid for the less liquid.  For if we have carried out our due diligence and qualified our buyer skillfully, as to the risk of non-performance he represents to us, we, in practice, can acquire more in that transaction, of that which is relatively more illiquid, only to mirthfully regale of the cash market we discover for it later.  Frictionless exchange is an arbitrage opportunity.  It is the cost of marketing.  It is the cost of fame. 

NOTE: _Of course, actual "frictionless" is hyperbole.  To be more precise, creative sellers will host transactions with less friction to responsible buyers, whenever possible to improve profit margins._

What does this all mean?   

## Ultimately, buyers _are_ money.  They do not need to have it.   

Consider your calendar as a potential bank of your very own fiat currency that you grant "bearers of your contracts" access to, upon request.  Inasmuch as you live, time is literally money, in the form of services you or those you have delegated can perform, in set periods you have expressly committed toward contract performance in accordance with guarantees, you, in consultation with a market, have prescribed.  You do not need permission from any Western government to grant loans, in denominations of your "contract measured labor" and or "contract measured calendaring", to others.  

Yes indeed.  You are money!  Everyone is.  Sellers can accept buyer promises to enable this wealth.
