First, try a cup of my lentil soup.  Relax.  Then, we will discuss your particular need and my prescription for a most compelling intervention.  

As you enjoy, consider.  What would you do to help make purchases more affordable for buyers, yet defend the most basic expectation, that buyers would respectfully reciprocate?  Let's suppose I asked you to pay me for that wonderous soup with fractions of your services in the form of contracts instead of money.  

Exactly, what would you offer me, in exchange?  And how much?  How would we define a "denomination"?  Moreover, as a service, can the service recipient's identity be made "reassignable" beyond me, the person such service was directly offered to?  In other words, would you be capable of honoring someone else's request for contract performance to render it?  If so, that would mean, we could engineer an actual contract for that service and it can become a commodity.  
 
And for every contract that you supply as payment, we can generate a digital signature for uniqueness that identifies you as the one who authored it and the seller as the one who received it, so beyond the benefit of simple tracking and attribution, if published, anyone can better understand how to use your contract as a surrogate of value.  Every time a seller accepts your contract, he or she can bear it as a buyer to another seller to propagate your existence and the availability of your services across an economy.

That's right. We are "ad hoc engineering" salient features of a hypothetical just-in-time national currency, whereby supply to the economy, of any buyer promise to perform services, takes place precisely upon any seller's acceptance of the promise as payment.  Eventually, some buyer will present the contract as payment to a seller who is actually looking for the literal service that it guarantees. Now at this point, whereby the seller, who is the new negotiable contract bearer, deliberately fails to perpetuate contract utility as an instrument of surrogate value, the maker of the contract has finally achieved his or her principal prospecting goal.  The expectation now is that the new contract bearer will subsequently request contract reconciliation.  He or she will attempt to schedule a service contract performance, to be executed by the contract maker or designee.  
   
Meaningfully here, I have actually articulated a reasonable process for how any country may achieve "full employment".  
  
Considering a judicious buyer restraint, hallmark of a responsible negotiable fiat contract maker, I posit, everything that is needed by a Citizen, anywhere, ultimately becomes affordable.  So, we can engineer "frictionless transactions" to address objections based upon price to start off our hypothetical economic boom.  With readily accessible supply that people can engineer, everyone can execute more transactions.  More transactions means, even more people with means can discover us, if only to subsidize strategically suffered inequitable cash exchanges to sustain ourselves.  No.  We are no longer held hostage to the inequity of any one transaction to make up a deficit.  "Frictionless" is only overtly a sacrifice of the liquid for the less liquid.  For if we have carried out our due dilligence and qualified our buyer skillfully, as to the risk of non-performance he represents to us, we, in practice, can acquire more in that transaction, of that which is relatively more illiquid than what the entire transaction was worth, only to mirthfully regale of the cash market we discover for it later.  Frictionless exchange is an arbitrage opportunity.  It is the cost of marketing.  It is the cost of fame. 

Of course, actual "frictionless" is hyperbole.  To be more precise, creative sellers will host transactions with less friction to responsible buyers, whenever possible.

What does this all mean?  

Well, consider that your schedule is your bank of your very own fiat currency that you grant "bearers of your contracts" to, upon bearer request.  Inasmuch as you yet live, time to you literally is money, in the form of services you or those you have delegated can perform, in set periods you have expressly committed toward contract performance in accordance with guarantees, you, in consultation with a market, have prescribed.  You do not need permission from any Western government to grant loans, in denominations of your "contract measured labor" and or "contract measured calendaring", to others.  

Yes.  What does this all mean?  You have all the real power.  You tell me!
