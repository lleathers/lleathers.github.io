Hello all.  I am _Larry Revander Leathers Jr._, an American macroeconomist, and co-founder of `Deliver Healthy`.  _Deliver Healthy_ is a farm-to-table logistics startup that "creates community" by crowdsourcing consumers as last-mile farm-to-table fulfillment agents.  We are organizing a global scale decentralized fulfillment network of crowdsourced refrigerators and shelves to make supply chains, threatened by extreme weather, more robust.
